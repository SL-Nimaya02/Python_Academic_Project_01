# Python_Academic_Project_01
The program allows students to predict their progress results at the end of each academic year.

## Features

- Validates credit inputs for correctness, range, and total.
- Efficient use of conditional statements to handle various outcomes.
- Allows staff members to predict progression outcomes for multiple students until they choose to quit.
- Generates a histogram showing the distribution of progression categories.
- Saves input progression data to different data structures (lists, dictionaries) for further analysis.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by executing `main.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to input credits for pass, defer, and fail.
3. The program will display the progression outcome for each student.
4. Enter 'q' to quit or 'y' to continue predicting outcomes for more students.
5. After exiting with 'q', a histogram will be displayed showing the distribution of progression categories.
6. Optionally, you can save the inputted progression data to a text file or access it later.
